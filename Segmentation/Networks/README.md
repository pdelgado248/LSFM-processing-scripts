This folder contains 2 subfolders with scripts to apply deep learning networks for segmentation. In the first one, some notebooks are presented to process LSFM images and obtain glomeruli segmentations. In the second, other notebooks allow to process these same images and store cyst segmentations.

Once created, these segmentations will be analysed using the scripts in the "./Data processing" folder to obtain the final results.
