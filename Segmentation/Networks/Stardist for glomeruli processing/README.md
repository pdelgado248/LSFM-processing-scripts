A 2D Stardist network was trained on annotations segmenting glomeruli in 2D patches. This training was done using the notebook from ZeroCostDL4Mic (https://github.com/HenriquesLab/ZeroCostDL4Mic/blob/master/Colab_notebooks/StarDist_2D_ZeroCostDL4Mic.ipynb). The trained network's parameters are inside the zipped folder "glomModelIllumCorrected5.zip". Unzipping it allows to use the notebooks in this folder to apply the network.
