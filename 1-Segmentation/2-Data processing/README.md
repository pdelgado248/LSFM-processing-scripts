Scripts for segmentation of the full kidney, inner region and cortex, inner cavities, glomeruli and cysts.
The code for the pygorpho library needs to be downloaded and installed in the main folder (https://github.com/patmjen/pygorpho) for the morphology operations to work properly.

Folders "Cysts", "Inner_region", "kidneys_vessels" and "obtainData" contain scripts with utility functions that are used to process each type of data. The other ".py" files in this folder are general utility scripts used for various different data.

There are two notebooks that allow to run the data processing pipeline:

1-segmentAndExtractData.ipynb: Contains several calls to functions in order to segment full kidneys, inner region and inner cavities, as well as post process cyst masks (previously created with the scripts at "./Networks", that also generate the glomeruli masks). It also extracts tabular data from all these masks for further analysis.

2-analyzeData.ipynb: Reads the data generated by the previous notebook, performs statistical analyses and creates plots.
