This folder contains 2 subfolders with scripts to apply deep learning networks for segmentation. In the first one (1-Stardist for glomeruli processing) some notebooks are presented to process LSFM images and obtain glomeruli segmentations. In the second (2-Unet for cyst processing), other notebooks allow to process these same images and store cyst segmentations.

Once created, these segmentations will be analysed using the scripts in the "./Data processing" folder to obtain the final results.
